# presidio-round2-shyam

Hi, I have made a python backend for round-2 of my presidio task - Teacher Management application. 
To run the application, please run it on a local machine. Since the updates are made to a json file system (Not supported by online python-intepreters).

Run with the lastest version of python.
preferrably python3.

Cmd: python3 presidio.py
